#Drupal Boilerplate#
-

Drupal boilerplate is not a module. Instead it just serves as a directory structure for
starting a new drupal site. The idea behind Drupal boilerplate came from working on so many
different sites which each follow their own development practice, directory structure,
deployment guidelines, etc...

Drupal boilerplate tries to simplifies starting a new site by having the most common
directory structures and files already included and set up.
